# Interactive simulation of a Collision Avoidance Algorithm with Deadlock Prediction and Recovery Based on Buffered Voronoi Cells. 

Simulation of a distributed multi-robot collision avoidance algorithm based on the concept of Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVC)*.\
An algorithm for deadlock prediction, deadlock recovery, and deadlock recovery success prediction is proposed and implemented.\
Deadlock avoidance with right-hand heuristics is also implemented for comparison.
